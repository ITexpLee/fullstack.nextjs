## Nextjs boilerplate with custom folder structure, setup for full stack development.

This project is an opinionated boilerplate for a fullstack workflow using a Nodejs server with express and NextJs for the React front end. The idea is to make it a solid boilerplate for large scale project projects. Using Docker for the build and production workflow and examples for CI / CD workflow and testing.

### Currently working with:
- Nextjs
  - Custom folder structure
- Redux
  - Redux-Sagas
  - Redux-Actions
  - Redux Dev Tools / Chrome extension for dev build
- Express server
  - Nodemon file watching
- Typescript
- Styled-Components

### Coming in some future updates:
- [ ] Apollo
- [ ] GraphQL
- [ ] Types for redux and Sagas
- [ ] Better use case examples and commenting
- [ ] Docker containerization for dev and prod
- [ ] CI / CD templates for launching and managing your full stack project
- [ ] Testing
