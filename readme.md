# Nextjs-Fullstackinator
## Nextjs boilerplate with custom folder structure, setup for full stack development.

### Currently working with:
- Nextjs
  - Custom folder structure
- Redux
  - Redux-Sagas
  - Redux-Actions
  - Redux Dev Tools / Chrome extension for dev build
- Express server
  - Nodemon file watching
- Typescript
- Styled-Components

### Coming in some future updates:
- [ ] Apollo
- [ ] GraphQL
- [ ] Types for redux and Sagas
- [ ] Better use case examples and commenting
- [ ] Docker containerization for dev and prod
- [ ] CI / CD for managing this project
- [ ] Maybe some testing... Who knows.

### Commands:
## Install:
Install all of those pesky node_modules<br>
`npm install`<br>
## Run development server:
Run the dev server with hot module reload and nodemon server auto restart<br>
`npm dev`<br>
## Build optimized server and client:
Build files are output to ./dist folder<br>
`npm build`<br>
## Run optimized build:
Runs the optimized build from the ./dist folder<br>
`npm start`<br>

### Contributions:
Please feel free to make pull requests if you have some code fixes or an idea for a possible better implementation of something. It is possible I may not accept a valid request if it does not suit my use case for this boilerplate.
